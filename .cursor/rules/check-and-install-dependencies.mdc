description: Automatically checks for and installs missing dependencies when libraries are requested in the prompt
globs: 
---
When a user requests to use specific libraries (e.g., GSAP, Framer Motion, etc.):

1. Check for the presence of the required libraries in the `package.json` file.
2. If any dependency is missing, automatically run the appropriate command to install it using the package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm).
3. Notify the user that the dependencies were checked and installed if necessary.
4. Proceed with the requested implementation only after the dependencies are properly installed.

#### Example:

**User Prompt:**  
> Create a hero section using GSAP and Framer Motion.

**AI Response (when dependencies are missing):**
(📝rule:check-and-install-dependencies) Checking for dependencies: GSAP and Framer Motion...
Missing dependencies detected. Installing now...

📦 Running:
npm install gsap framer-motion

✅ Installation complete. Proceeding with hero section implementation...


**AI Response (when dependencies are already installed):**
(📝rule:check-and-install-dependencies) All required dependencies (GSAP, Framer Motion) are already installed. Proceeding with hero section implementation...


### Notes:
- The AI should first verify the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- If dependencies are missing, the installation will proceed using the appropriate package manager.
- Once the dependencies are successfully installed, the implementation can proceed.
